  <h1> Harry Westbrook </h1>

  <article class="index">
    <p>Hi I'm Harry and this is my website designed for a piece of WEBF1 coursework. I am currently studying Computing at the University of Portsmouth and this is my first venture into the realms of HTML and CSS.</p>

    <p>I am currently a student studying at the University of Portsmouth and this website was created for the purpose of my Web Foundation studies to allow me to document my progress of working with HTML and CSS along with anything else I may discover along the way related to website design and development. The end purpose of creating this website is to submit it for an assignment for review and marking towards my final first year grade.</P>

    <p> As well as this I plan to keep this website and eventually have it running from its own server and have it live on the internet. I plan to continue to develop and update this site after it has been submitted and use it as my own personal site for people to be able to access and find more information about me and what I am doing over the course of my degree and the experiences and learning I have over this time.</p>

    <p> Please note that in the footer of each page are 2 links that will allow you to validate both the CSS <i class="fa fa-css3" fa-4x></i> and the HTML <i class="fa fa-html5" fa-4x></i> for the page if you so wish by using W3Schools online validator.</p>
